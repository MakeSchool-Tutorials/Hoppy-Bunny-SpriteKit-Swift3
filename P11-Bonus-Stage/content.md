Welcome to the bonus stage! Your challenge, should you choose to accept, is to work through the list of challenges which will take your game to the next level.

There are no solutions provided and I would encourage you to discuss potential solutions with your fellow students: it's good to collaborate and often results in new and exciting directions.

If you have any challenge suggestions, we would love to hear them. Please provide feedback at this tutorial's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/Hoppy-Bunny-SpriteKit-Swift3).

It would be a good idea to create a **new branch** in your repository for these challenges. If you need help doing this, ask an instructor!

#Parallax scrolling

You currently have a single scrolling ground, how can you improve this?

Let's take a look at a classic:

![Mario Parallax](https://hallme.com/uploads/parallax-scrolling-mario.gif)

Notice the different layers of the background all scrolling at different speeds, this effect is called [Parallax Scrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_scrolling).

> [challenge]
> Can you implement parallax scrolling?
> **Hint**: Try starting with the clouds, and don't forget that you already have a ground scrolling method...

#Progressive difficulty

The game starts hard and never quits. This was by design. However, what if you wanted to ease the player in and progressively ramp up the difficulty?

> [challenge]
> How many ways can you think up to make the game easier and how can you then scale up the difficulty?

#Rewarding achievement

When the player passes through each obstacle, it's not very rewarding. How about adding a little sparkle to the event?

> [challenge]
> How many ways can you think of to make this experience more rewarding?
> **Hint**: We've included a rewarding coin sound effect in the sound effects pack you added to your project :]

#High score

When the player dies there is no display of the high score. It would be good to present this as a challenge for the next player!

> [challenge]
> Can you add a high score display mechanic?

#Button Node

The current implementation of *MSButtonNode* is intentionally simple, it would be great if the button could provide some feedback that it's been touched. This could be a combination of visual effects and/or sound effects. It could even trigger the phone to vibrate!

> [challenge]
> Enhance *MSButtonNode*

If you make a nice *MSButtonNode* you can use it to enhance your own game projects later!

#Device scaling and anchoring

If you run the game under iPhone 6/6S Plus and look closely you will see that the restart button and score counter are positioned slightly to the right, instead of dead center.

> [challenge]
> Why do you think this is and can you solve it?

**Note:** Universal device support will be covered in greater detail in the Peeved Penguins tutorial.
